For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backwards compatibility, this code will be maintained under the **Semantic Versioning guidelines** as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

Example: `1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0-alpha.1 < 1.0.0-alpha.beta < 1.0.0-beta < 1.0.0-beta.2 < 1.0.0-beta.11 < 1.0.0-rc.1 < 1.0.0`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

- Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
- New additions without breaking backwards compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
- Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
