Bones is also the name of the command-line interface included with **WP Kirk boilerplate**. It provides a number of helpful commands for your use while developing your plugin. You will use bones command-line interface to start your develop. First of all, try the command-line console by running:

    php bones

Then, you can change the plugin namespace from `WPKirk` to `MyFirstWPBonesPlugin`, for example:

    php bones rename 'My First WP Bones Plugin' MyFirstWPBonesPlugin

Awesome! You are quite ready to start to develop.

### Updated

Of course, while you are in developing, you may update the WP Bones framework. You can do this by using `update` bones command:

    php bones update

> Currently we will get the `develop` branch.

### Deploy

When your plugin is ready, you can use the `deploy` bones command in order to create a new folder useful to submit your plugin to the wordpress.org repository:

    php bones deploy /var/www/mydeploy

In the `mydeploy` folder you'll find only the needed files to run your plugin. For example, the `node_modules` folder will be deleted as well as the `resources/assets`.

### Customize Deploy

Of course, you may customize the deploy process by editing the `deploy.php` file. In this file you can add your own commands to run before and after the deploy. You will find also some actions and filters to customize the deploy process.

For example, you can add any custom command to run before the deploy by using:

```php
/**
* Fired when the deploy command is started
*
* @param object $console Instance of WPBones Console
* @param string $path Destination path
*/
add_action('wpbones_console_deploy_start', function ($console, $path) {
    // Do something
}, 10, 2);
```

Or change the list of skipped files by using:

```php
/**
* Filter the list of the folder to skip for the deploy version
*
* @param array $folders List of folders to skip
* @return array List of folders to skip
*/
add_filter('wpbones_console_deploy_skip_folders', function ($folders) {
    return $folders;
});
```

### Creators

The Bones command console provides a set of commands to create some base classes. For example, you may create a Custom Post Type by using:

    php bones make:cpt MyCustomPostTypeClass

### To require Packages

You can install third-party packages by using:

```sh copy
php bones require <PackageName>
```

I advise you use this command instead of `composer require` because by doing so, an automatic renaming will be done.
