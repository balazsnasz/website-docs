# Official WP Bones packages

Although WordPress doesn't support Composer, we can use the `composer.json` to install third-party packages.
Of course, to write a WP Bones package, you should follow some special rules.

## How to write a WP Bones package

To write a WP Bones package, you have to use the WP Kirk template and the WP Kirk namespace

<Steps>

### Clone the WP Kirk template plugin

```sh copy
git clone -b main https://github.com/wpbones/WPKirk.git <your plugin folder>
```

### Edit composer.json

Edit the `composer.json` file of your package and use the following syntax:

```json copy
...
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
       "WPKirk\\YourPackage\\": "src/"
    }
  },
...
```

```sh copy
php bones update
```

The `bones` command will perform a namespace rename.

For more details, check the source code of [Morris php](https://github.com/wpbones/morris-php).

There you'll find a list of the official WP Bones packages. Feel free to create your own WP Bones package and send me a request to add it.
