# Official WP Bones packages

Although Wordpress doesn't support composer, we can use the `composer.json` to install third party packages.
Of course, to write a WP Bones package you should follow some special rules.

## How to write a WP Bones package

Edit the `composer.json` file of your package and use the following syntax:

```json copy
...
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
       "WPKirk\\YourPackage\\": "src/"
    }
  },
...
```

You should use `WPKirk` like namespace. So, I suggest you to write and test your package in the WPKirk boilerplate.

```sh copy
git clone -b boilerplate https://github.com/wpbones/WPKirk.git <your plugin folder>
```

All above is necessary because when you'll use:

```sh copy
php bones update
```

The bones command will perform a rename of the namespace.
For more details, have a look at the source code of [Morris php](https://github.com/wpbones/morris-php).

There you'll find a list of the official WP Bones packages. Feel free to write your own WP Bones package and send me a request in order to add it.
