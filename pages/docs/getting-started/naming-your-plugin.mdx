# Naming Your Plugin

When you install **your plugin**, you may wish to change the plugin name. This is a common practice when you are using **bones** as a starting point for your plugin development.

Let's rename the plugin name and the namespace:

```shell copy
php bones rename '<your plugin name>' '<your namespace>'
```

If you leave blank `<your plugin name>`, a command line prompt will be displayed and you will be asked to enter a new Plugin name. Bones command will use this information to perform some changes into the code. Also, **bones** command will use it as namespace as well as slug. For example, if you enter `My WP Plugin`, bones command will create:

```
My WP Plugin          Name of plugin
MyWPPlugin            Namespace, see [PSR-4 autoloading standard](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/)
my_wp_plugin_slug     Plugin slug
my_wp_plugin_vars     Plugin vars used for CPT, taxonomy, etc.
my-wp-plugin          Internal id used for css, js and less files
```

## Naming Your Plugin again

After installing **your plugin**, you may wish to change the plugin name again.

<Callout type="warning">
Remember that a plugin name is bound to PHP namespace. This because WordPress doesn't support namespace in current plugin architecture.
</Callout>


You can do this, by using the `rename` command in bones command line:

```shell copy
php bones rename 'WP My Awesome Plugin'
```

In this case, you will get:

```
WP My Awesome Plugin          Name of plugin
WPMyAwesomePlugin             Namespace (PSR-4)
wp_my_awesome_plugin_slug     Plugin slug
wp_my_awesome_plugin_vars     Plugin vars used for CPT, taxonomy, etc.
wp-my-awesome_plugin          Internal id used for css, js and less files
```

## Options

You may also reset the plugin name and the namespace to the orginal version.

```shell copy
php bones rename --reset
```

In addition to that, you may also update the namespace after a composer update.

```shell copy
php bones rename --update
```

<Callout type="info">
Probably, you won't need to that as the update flow is already in the composer file
</Callout>


```json copy
...
  "scripts": {
    "post-autoload-dump": [
      "php -r \"copy('vendor/wpbones/wpbones/src/Console/bin/bones', 'bones');\"",
      "php bones rename --update"
    ]
  }
  ...
```
