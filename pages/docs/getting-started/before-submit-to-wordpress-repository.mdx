# Before submitting your plugin to the WordPress repository

<Callout type="warning">
Before submitting your plugin to the WordPress repository directory, you should know some **important** information about code style.
</Callout>

When you will submit your plugin to the WordPress repository, some line of code could be rejected. This may happen because WordPress repository provides a set of pre-commit hooks. These are performed during the commit process. These hooks will perform a PHP checking, below you'll find a list of possible error in your code:

```php
// will be rejected by WordPress.org
$list = [
  MyNamespace\MyClass::class
];

// correct
$list = [
  'MyNamespace\MyClass'
];
```

```php
// will be rejected by WordPress.org
if( empty( MyInstance::method() ) ) { 
  ... 
}

// correct
$result = MyInstance::method();
if( empty( $result ) ) { 
   ... 
}
```

```php
// will be rejected by WordPress.org
static::class
  
// right
get_called_class();
```
