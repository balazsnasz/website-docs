# Views

The views provide the UI and interaction with the end user. Usually, a view is a link in WordPress. The menus, for example, are a way to display a view.

## Basic Usage

Views contain the HTML served by your plugin and separate your controller / plugin logic from your presentation logic. Views are stored in the `resources/views` directory. A view is usually bound with a menu. So, you will handle your view from an inside method of View Controller. In the [Menus](#menus) section we have already used a View Controller in the menu array:

```php copy
...
'route' => [ 'get' => 'Dashboard\DashboardController@firstMenu' ],
...
```

Now, let's see a simple View Controller used to display a view:

```php copy
<?php

namespace WPKirk\Http\Controllers\Dashboard;

use WPKirk\Http\Controllers\Controller;

class DashboardController extends Controller {

  public function firstMenu()
  {
    return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' );
  }
}
```

The "Dot" notation provides a simple way to organise the views. In this example, we will have the following files structure `resources/views/dashboard/index.php`. The `index.php` file is the HTML/PHP file:

```html copy
<div class="wrap">
  <h1>Hello, captain!</h1>
</div>
```

<Callout>
You may use any PHP code inside the view.
</Callout>

## Passing Data To Views

As in Laravel, we may easily pass any data to the views:

```php copy
return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )->with( [ 'kirk' => 'Captain' ] );
```

So, inside your view, you can then access the data by using its corresponding keys, such as `<?php echo $kirk; ?>`.

```html copy
<div class="wrap">
  <h1>Hello, <?php echo $kirk; ?>!</h1>
</div>
```

As an alternative to passing a complete array of data to the view, you may use the `with` method to add individual pieces of data to the view:

```php copy
return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )->with( 'kirk', 'Captain' );
```

In addition, you will able to get your plugin instance by `$plugin` variable.

In this release, you'll find the `$plugin` variable auto set to the plugin instance. This variable is reserved.
</Callout>


## Enqueue Styles and Scripts in Admin area

You may enqueue all registered styles and scripts when a view is displayed. All styles and scripts files must be located in `public/` folder. The `.css` files will be got in the `public/css/` folder and the `.js` files will be got in the `public/js/` folder. Currently, you can use `withAdminStyles` and `withAdminScripts` methods. For example:

```php copy
return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )
               ->with( [ 'kirk' => 'Captain' ] )
               ->withAdminStyles( 'wp-kirk-common' );
```

The file `public/css/wp-kirk-common.css` will be registered and enqueued when the view is displayed.

## Localize Scripts

You may localize your scripts by using the `localizeScript` method. For example:

```php copy
return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )
               ->with( [ 'kirk' => 'Captain' ] )
               ->withAdminScript( 'wp-kirk-common' )
               ->withLocalizeScripts('wp-kirk-common', 'wpKirkGlobal', [
                  'ajaxUrl' => admin_url('admin-ajax.php'),
                  'nonce' => wp_create_nonce('wp-kirk-nonce')
          ]);
```
As you know, you will be able to access to `wpKirkGlobal` variable in your scripts. For example:

```javascript copy
(function($) {
  'use strict';
  
  // Post data to the server
  $.ajax({
    url: wpKirkGlobal.ajaxUrl,
    type: 'POST',
    data: {
      action: 'wp_kirk_action',
      nonce: wpKirkGlobal.nonce
    },
    success: function(response) {
      console.log(response);
    }
  });
})(jQuery);
```





## Enqueue Style and Scripts in Frontend

Also, you can enqueue scripts and styles in the frontend, for example when you will display a view for a widget. In this case, you can use `withStyles` and `withScripts` fluent methods. All these methods accept three params: name, deps and version:

```php copy
return WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.index' )
               ->with( [ 'kirk' => 'Captain' ] )
               ->withAdminStyles( 'wp-kirk-common', [ 'wp-kir-colors' ], '1.0' );
```

## Fragment

A very useful feature of View is the ability to include another View. For example, you could use the following:

```html copy
<h1>
  Main view in file "/views/main.php"
</h1>
<?php echo WPKirk()->view( 'fragment' ) ?>
```

In the above example, we are going to load the `/view/fragment.php` view into the main view. This feature is very usuful for loops or dynamic parts of a view. Let's show a more complete example:

```html copy
<!-- this main view: echo WPKirk()->view( 'main' )->with( 'items', $items ) -->
<h1>
  Main view in file "/views/main.php"
</h1>
<?php echo WPKirk()->view( 'list-items' ) ?>
```

In the `/views/list-items.php` you'll find:

```html copy
<ul>
<?php foreach( $items as $item ) : ?>
  <li><?php echo $item ?></li>
<?php endforach; ?>
</ul>
```

<Callout>
Of course, if you have used a folder for your views, you will have to add it to the fragment.
</Callout>


```html copy
<h1>
  Main view in file "/views/dasboard/index.php"
</h1>
<?php echo WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.list-items' ) ?>
```

## Content

Of course, you may get the content of a view and use it in several way. For example, to send an email.

```php copy
$content = WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.list-items' )
                   ->toHTML();
```
or

```php copy
$content = WPKirk()->view( 'dashboard.list-items' )
                   ->render( true );
```

## Ajax

You may wish to return a view or a fragment of a view as a JSON return. In this case, you can use:

```php copy
wp_send_json_success(
  [
    'feedback' => WPKirk()->view( 'tools.index' )->render()
  ]
);
```
The `render` method will verify if the call is by Ajax and it will return the processed HTML.
