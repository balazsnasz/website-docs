# Seeding

Likewise Laravel, WP Bones includes the ability to seed your database with data using seed classes. All seed classes are stored in the `database/seeders` directory.
The seeder classes will be loaded and executed when the plugin is activated.

## Writing Seeders

A seeder class only contains one method by default: `run`. You have to define the table name as well.
Below, an example of seeder class used in the [wpbones/geolocalizer](https://packagist.org/packages/wpbones/geolocalizer) package.

<Callout type="info">
Currently, there is no way to write seeders by `php bones`. We are working on that.
</Callout>


```php copy
<?php
// remember that your namespace will be different
use WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Seeder;

// you have to return an instance of WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Seeder
return new class extends Seeder {
  /**
   * It will be converted to lowercase and with the WordPress prefix.
   *
   * @var string The table name.
   */
  protected $tablename = "countries";

  // the seeder run method is called automatically
  // here you can do everything you need to do
  public function run()
  {
      // for example, here we are going to truncate the table
      $this->truncate();

      // and then we are going to insert some data
      $this->insert(
      "(id, zone, country, isocode, currency, symbol, symbol_html, code, tax, continent, status)
      VALUES
      	(1,'','Mauritania','MR','Mauritanian Ouguiya','','','MRO',0.00,'africa','publish')");
  }
}
```

Currently, the seeder is executed when the plugin is activated. If you want to execute the seeder just one time, you can set the `runOnce` property to `true`.

```php copy
<?php
// remember that your namespace will be different
use WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Seeder;

// you have to return an instance of WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Seeder
return new class extends Seeder {
  /**
   * It will be converted to lowercase and with the WordPress prefix.
   *
   * @var string The table name.
   */
  protected $tablename = "my_plugin_products";

  // Run the database seeds just once
  protected $runOnce = true;

  // the seeder run method is called automatically
  // here you can do everything you need to do
  public function run()
  {
      // since the seeder is executed only one time, we can remove the truncate method
      //$this->truncate();

      // and then we are going to insert some data
      $this->insert(
      "(id, zone, country, isocode, currency, symbol, symbol_html, code, tax, continent, status)
      VALUES
      	(1,'','Mauritania','MR','Mauritanian Ouguiya','','','MRO',0.00,'africa','publish')");
  }
}
```

## Use a Model

You can use a model to seed your database.

```php copy
<?php
// remember that your namespace will be different
use WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Seeder;

// you have to use your model
use WPKirk\Models\MyPluginProducts;

// you have to return an instance of WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Seeder
return new class extends Seeder {
  /**
   * It will be converted to lowercase and with the WordPress prefix.
   *
   * @var string The table name.
   */
  protected $tablename = "my_plugin_products";

  // the seeder run method is called automatically
  // here you can do everything you need to do
  public function run()
  {
    // insert by using the model class
    MyPluginProducts::insert([
        ['name' => 'iMac', 'price' => '100000'],
        ['name' => 'iPhone', 'price' => '20000'],
        ['name' => 'iPad', 'price' => '30000'],
        ['name' => 'iPod', 'price' => '10000'],
      ]
    );
  }
}
```
