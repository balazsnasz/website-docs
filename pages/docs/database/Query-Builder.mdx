WP Bones's database query builder provides a convenient, fluent interface to creating and running database queries. It can be used to perform most database operations in your WordPress instance.

> This embed version of Query Builder is a light version of the original. It does not include the advanced features of the original.

## Retrieving All Rows From A Table

You may use the `table` method provided by the `DB` class to begin a query. The `table` method returns a fluent query builder instance for the given table, allowing you to chain more constraints onto the query and then finally retrieve the results of the query using the `get` method:

```php
<?php

namespace WPKirk\Http\Controllers;

use WPKirk\WPBones\Database\DB;

class UserController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Get the list of all WordPress users.
     *
     */
    public function index()
    {
        $users = DB::table('users')->get();
    }
}
```

The `get` method returns an `WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Support\Collection` instance containing the results of the query where each result is an instance of the PHP `stdClass` object. You may access each column's value by accessing the column as a property of the object:

```php
use WPKirk\WPBones\Database\DB;

$users = DB::table('users')->get();

foreach ($users as $user) {
    echo $user->name;
}
```

## Retrieving A Single Row / Column From A Table

If you just need to retrieve a single row from a database table, you may use the `DB` class's `first` method. This method will return a single `stdClass` object:

```php
use WPKirk\WPBones\Database\DB;

$user = DB::table('users')->where('user_login', 'admin')->first();

return $user->email;
```

To retrieve a single row by its `id` column value, use the `find` method:

```php
use WPKirk\WPBones\Database\DB;

$user = DB::table('users')->find(3);
```

## Retrieving A List Of Column Values

If you would like to retrieve an `WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Support\Collection` instance containing the values of a single column, you may use the `pluck` method. In this example, we'll retrieve a collection of user names:

```php
use WPKirk\WPBones\Database\DB;

$names = DB::table('users')->pluck('user_login');

foreach ($names as $name) {
    echo $name;
}
```

## Aggregates

The query builder also provides a variety of methods for retrieving aggregate values like `count` (max, min, avg, and sum in progress yet). You may call any of these methods after constructing your query:

```php
use WPKirk\WPBones\Database\DB;

$users = DB::table('users')->count();
```

# Select Statements

## Specifying A Select Clause

You may not always want to select all columns from a database table. Using the `select` method, you can specify a custom "select" clause for the query:

```php
use WPKirk\WPBones\Database\DB;

$users = DB::table('users')
            ->select('user_login', 'user_email as email')
            ->get();
```

# Basic Where Clauses

## Where Clauses

You may use the query builder's `where` method to add "where" clauses to the query. The most basic call to the `where` method requires three arguments. The first argument is the name of the column. The second argument is an operator, which can be any of the database's supported operators. The third argument is the value to compare against the column's value.

For example, the following query retrieves users where the value of the `user_login` column is equal to `admin` and the value of the `user_status` column is greater than `0`:

```php
$users = DB::table('users')
                ->where('user_login', '=', 'admin')
                ->where('user_status', '>', 0)
                ->get();
```

For convenience, if you want to verify that a column is `=` to a given value, you may pass the value as the second argument to the `where` method. WP Bones will assume you would like to use the `=` operator:

```php
$users = DB::table('users')->where('user_login', 'admin')->get();
```

As previously mentioned, you may use any operator that is supported by your database system:

```php
$users = DB::table('users')
                ->where('user_status', '>=', 100)
                ->get();

$users = DB::table('users')
                ->where('user_status', '<>', 100)
                ->get();

$users = DB::table('users')
                ->where('display_name', 'like', 'T%')
                ->get();
```

You may also pass an array of conditions to the `where` function. Each element of the array should be an array containing the three arguments typically passed to the `where` method:

```php
$users = DB::table('users')->where([
    ['user_status', '=', '0'],
    ['display_name', 'like', 'r%'],
])->get();
```

## Or Where Clauses

When chaining together calls to the query builder's `where` method, the "where" clauses will be joined together using the `and` operator. However, you may use the `orWhere` method to join a clause to the query using the or operator. The `orWhere` method accepts the same arguments as the `where` method:

```php
$users = DB::table('users')
                    ->where('user_status', '>', 0)
                    ->orWhere('user_login', 'root')
                    ->get();
```

## Additional Where Clauses

### whereBetween / orWhereBetween

The `whereBetween` method verifies that a column's value is between two values:

```php
$users = DB::table('users')
           ->whereBetween('user_status', [1, 100])
           ->get();
```

### whereNotBetween / orWhereNotBetween

The `whereNotBetween` method verifies that a column's value lies outside of two values:

```php
$users = DB::table('users')
           ->whereNotBetween('id', [1, 100])
           ->get();
```

### whereIn / whereNotIn / orWhereIn / orWhereNotIn

The `whereIn` method verifies that a given column's value is contained within the given array:

```php
$users = DB::table('users')
                    ->whereIn('id', [1, 2, 3])
                    ->get();
```

# Ordering, Limit & Offset

## Ordering

## The `orderBy` Method

The `orderBy` method allows you to sort the results of the query by a given column. The first argument accepted by the `orderBy` method should be the column you wish to sort by, while the second argument determines the direction of the sort and may be either asc or desc:

```php
$users = DB::table('users')
                ->orderBy('display_name', 'desc')
                ->get();
```

To sort by multiple columns, you may simply invoke `orderBy` as many times as necessary:

```php
$users = DB::table('users')
                ->orderBy('display_name', 'desc')
                ->orderBy('user_email', 'asc')
                ->get();
```

# Limit & Offset

You may use the `limit` and `offset` methods to limit the number of results returned from the query or to skip a given number of results in the query:

```php
$users = DB::table('users')
                ->offset(10)
                ->limit(5)
                ->get();
```

# Insert Statements

The query builder also provides an `insert` method that may be used to insert records into the database table. The `insert` method accepts an array of column names and values:

```php
DB::table('users')->insert([
    'user_email' => 'kayla@example.com',
    'user_login' => 'kayla',
]);
```

You may insert several records at once by passing an array of arrays. Each array represents a record that should be inserted into the table:

```php
DB::table('users')->insert([
    ['user_email' => 'picard@example.com', 'user_login' => 'picard'],
    ['user_email' => 'janeway@example.com', 'user_login' => 'janeway'],
]);
```

# Update Statements

In addition to inserting records into the database, the query builder can also update existing records using the `update` method. The `update` method, like the insert method, accepts an array of column and value pairs indicating the columns to be updated. You may constrain the `update` query using `where` clauses:

```php
$affected = DB::table('users')
              ->where('id', 1)
              ->update(['user_email' => 'janeway@example.com']);
```

You may also use:

```php
$user = DB::table('users')->find(1);
$user->user_email = 'janeway@example.com';
$user->save();
```

# Delete Statements

The query builder's `delete` method may be used to delete records from the table. You may constrain `delete` statements by adding "where" clauses before calling the `delete` method:

```php
DB::table('users')->delete();

DB::table('users')->where('id', '>', 100)->delete();
```

If you wish to truncate an entire table, which will remove all records from the table and reset the auto-incrementing ID to zero, you may use the `truncate` method:

```php
DB::table('users')->truncate();
```

# Debugging

You may use the `dump` methods while building a query to dump the current query bindings and SQL. The `dump` method will display the records returned by the query in a JSON pretty-printed format:

```php
echo DB::table('users')->get()->dump();
```

```json
[
	{
		"ID": "1",
		"user_login": "root",
		"user_pass": "$P$BcsZ.SCXT1ItPV5vE.sRTwBpqx.vHs0",
		"user_nicename": "root",
		"user_email": "giovambattista.fazioli@gmail.com",
		"user_url": "",
		"user_registered": "2019-05-22 09:50:02",
		"user_activation_key": "",
		"user_status": "0",
		"display_name": "root"
	}
]
```
