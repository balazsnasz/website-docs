# Installation


<Steps>
### Create your local WordPress installation

First of all, you should prepare the development environment. I may suggest you the following:

- [Vagrant](https://github.com/gfazioli/VagrantUbuntu)
- [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/valet)

<Callout>
I suggest you to use also [PHP Monitor](https://phpmon.app/) is a lightweight, native Mac menu bar app that works best when accompanied by [Laravel Valet](https://github.com/laravel/valet) (but it also works without it).
</Callout>

In order to start to develop a WP Bones plugin, you must have a copy of WordPress files. You can download the last WordPress release from [wordpress.org](#http://wordpress.org).


### Create your plugin

To create yor WP bones plugin you can use one of our ready-made templates available on GitHub. You can choose one of the following:

 - [WPKirk Complete Demo](https://github.com/wpbones/WPKirk) - this is the template with several examples inside, **recommended for beginners**
 - [WPKirk Boilerplate](https://github.com/wpbones/WPKirk-Boilerplate) - this is the base template, without examples inside, **recommended for experienced users**

for both, you can choose to create your repository on GitHub using the available templates. Or you can clone the repository directly to your computer.

#### By using the GitHub template

On GitHub, you can create a new repository using the [WP Kirk template](https://github.com/wpbones/WPKirk) by clicking on the "Use this template" button on the repository page.

  <Card arrow icon={<IconBrandGithub />} title="Create your repository starting from a complete demo - beginners" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/new?template_name=WPKirk&template_owner=wpbones"/>

  
  <Card arrow icon={<IconBrandGithub />} title="Create your repository starting from a empty boilerplate - advanced users" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/new?template_name=WPKirk-Boilerplate&template_owner=wpbones"/>

</Cards>  
  

#### Clone from GitHub

You may also clone the repository using either the Git command line or the Github for Mac application.
Change directory to the `wp-content/plugins` folder of your local WordPress installation.

```sh copy
cd wp-content/plugins
```

The complete demo

```sh copy
git clone -b main https://github.com/wpbones/WPKirk.git <your plugin folder>
```

The simple boilerplate

```sh copy
git clone -b main https://github.com/wpbones/WPKirk-Boilerplate.git <your plugin folder>
```

<Callout type="warning">
If you have cloned the repository instead of using the GitHub template, you should remove the `.git` folder before creating your own Git repository.
So run 

```sh copy
rm -rf .git
```
</Callout>

### Install the dependencies packages to compile the assets

From inside your plugin folder, run:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install
```
Take a look at the [Assets](assets) section to learn more.


### Check the installation

Next, from inside your plugin folder try to run:

```shell copy
php bones
```


You should see:

```shell
  o       o o--o      o--o
  |       | |   |     |   |
  o   o   o O--o      O--o  o-o o-o  o-o o-o
   \ / \ /  |         |   | | | |  | |-'  \
    o   o   o         o--o  o-o o  o o-o o-o
