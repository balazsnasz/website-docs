# Before submitting your plugin to the WordPress repository

<Callout type="warning">
Before submitting your plugin to the WordPress repository directory, you should know some **important** information about code style.
</Callout>

## Install Plugin Check (PCP)

The first thing you should do is to install the [Plugin Check](https://github.com/WordPress/plugin-check).
You can download the zip file from the [releases page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-check/).
This plugin will check your plugin for errors and warnings before you submit it to the WordPress repository.
You will be able to see the errors and warnings in the WordPress admin panel.

## Knowlegde potential issues

When you will submit your plugin to the WordPress repository, some line of code could be rejected. This may happen because WordPress repository provides a set of pre-commit hooks. These are performed during the commit process. These hooks will perform a PHP checking, below you'll find a list of possible error in your code:

```php
// will be rejected by WordPress.org
$list = [
  MyNamespace\MyClass::class
];

// correct
$list = [
  'MyNamespace\MyClass'
];
```

```php
// will be rejected by WordPress.org
if( empty( MyInstance::method() ) ) { 
  ... 
}

// correct
$result = MyInstance::method();
if( empty( $result ) ) { 
   ... 
}
```

```php
// will be rejected by WordPress.org
static::class
  
// right
get_called_class();
```

## Deploy version

You will have to use the bones `deploy` command to create the deply version of your plugin.
See [here](../BonesConsole/bones-console#deploy) for more details.
