# Before submitting your plugin to the WordPress repository

<Callout type="warning">
Before submitting your plugin to the WordPress repository directory, you should know some **important** information about code style.
</Callout>

## Install Plugin Check (PCP)

The first thing you should do is to install the [Plugin Check](https://github.com/WordPress/plugin-check).
You can download the zip file from the [releases page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-check/).
This plugin will check your plugin for errors and warnings before you submit it to the WordPress repository.
You will be able to see the errors and warnings in the WordPress admin panel.

## Knowlegde potential issues

When you submit your plugin to the WordPress repository, some lines of code could be rejected. This may happen because the WordPress repository provides a set of pre-commit hooks. These are performed during the commit process. These hooks will perform PHP checking. Below you'll find a list of possible errors in your code:

```php copy
// will be rejected by WordPress.org
$list = [
  MyNamespace\MyClass::class
];

// correct
$list = [
  'MyNamespace\MyClass'
];
```

```php copy
// will be rejected by WordPress.org
if( empty( MyInstance::method() ) ) { 
  ... 
}

// correct
$result = MyInstance::method();
if( empty( $result ) ) { 
   ... 
}
```

```php copy
// will be rejected by WordPress.org
static::class
  
// right
get_called_class();
```

## Deploy version

You will have to use the `deploy` command to create the deploy version of your plugin. See [here](../BonesConsole/bones-console#deploy) for more details.
