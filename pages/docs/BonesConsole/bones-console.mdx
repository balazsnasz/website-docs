# Bones Command-Line Interface

Bones is also the name of the command-line interface included with [WP Kirk template](https://github.com/wpbones/WPKirk-Boilerplate). It provides a number of helpful commands for your use while developing your plugin. You will use the Bones command-line interface to start your development. First of all, try the command-line console by running:

```sh copy
php bones
```

Then, you can change the plugin namespace from `WPKirk` to `MyFirstWPBonesPlugin`, for example:

```sh copy
php bones rename 'My First WP Bones Plugin' MyFirstWPBonesPlugin
```

Great! You are quite ready to start developing.

### Update WP Bones

While you are developing, you can update the WP Bones framework. You can do this by using the `update bones` command.

```sh copy
php bones update
```

### Versioning your Plugin

You can version your plugin by using:

```sh copy
php bones version 1.0.0
```

The above command will update the plugin version in the main plugin file and in the `readme.txt` file.

<Callout type="info">
Despite PHP Bones supporting semantic versioning, we suggest you use the same version in the `readme.txt` file and in the main plugin file. In short, avoid using the `v` prefix in the version number.
</Callout>

You can see the help by using:

```sh copy
php bones version --help

readme.txt > 1.4.0 (Stable tag: 1.4.0)
wp-kirk.php  > 1.4.0 ( * Version: 1.4.0)

Usage:
  version [plugin version]

Arguments:
  [plugin version]		    The version of plugin. Examples: '2.0',  'v1.2',  '1.2.0-rc.40', 'v1-beta.4'
  [--major]			        Increment the <major>.y.z of plugin.
  [--minor]			        Increment the x.<minor>.z of plugin.
  [--patch]			        Increment the x.y.<patch> of plugin.
  [--pre-patch] <prefix>	Increment the x.y.<patch>-<prefix>.<i> of plugin.
  [--pre-minor] <prefix>	Increment the x.<minor>.z-<prefix>.<i> of plugin.
  [--pre-major] <prefix>	Increment the <major>.y.z-<prefix>.<i> of plugin.
```

#### Available Options

The `php bones version` command can handle the version starting from the current version of the plugin. You can use the following options:

* `--major` to increment the major version number. For example, if the current version is `1.0.0`, the new version will be `2.0.0`.
* `--minor` to increment the minor version number. For example, if the current version is `1.0.0`, the new version will be `1.1.0`.
* `--patch` to increment the patch version number. For example, if the current version is `1.0.0`, the new version will be `1.0.1`.

You can also use the `--pre-patch`, `--pre-minor`, and `--pre-major` options to increment the version with a prefix. For example, if the current version is `1.0.0`, the new version will be `1.0.1-rc.1`.

The default prefix is `rc`. But you can change it by using: 

```sh copy
php bones version 1.0.0 --pre-patch beta
```

The above command will update the plugin version to `1.0.1-beta.1`.

### Deploy your Plugin

When your plugin is ready, you can use the `deploy` bones command in order to create a new folder useful to submit your plugin to the wordpress.org repository.

```sh copy
php bones deploy your-path/mydeploy
```
<Callout type="info">
Starting from WP Bones `v1.5.0` we added a new option `--wp` to deploy the plugin to the WordPress repository. This option will create a deploy folder with the necessary files to submit your plugin to the WordPress repository. For further information, see [here](../GettingStarted/before-submit-to-wordpress-repository).
</Callout>

In the `mydeploy` folder, you will find only the necessary files to run your plugin. 
Without the `--wp` option the developer's `resources/assets` folder will be removed.

### Customize Deploy

Of course, you may customize the deployment process by editing the `deploy.php` file. In this file, you can add your own commands to run before and after the deployment. You will also find some actions and filters to customize the deployment process.

For example, you can add any custom command to run before the deployment by using:

```php copy
/**
* Fired when the deploy command is started
*
* @param object $console Instance of WPBones Console
* @param string $path Destination path
*/
add_action('wpbones_console_deploy_start', function ($console, $path) {
    // Do something
}, 10, 2);
```

Or change the list of skipped files by using:

```php copy
/**
* Filter the list of the folder to skip for the deploy version
*
* @param array $folders List of folders to skip
* @return array List of folders to skip
*/
add_filter('wpbones_console_deploy_skip_folders', function ($folders) {
    return $folders;
});
```

### Creators

The Bones command console provides a set of commands to create some base classes. For example, you can create a Custom Post Type by using:

```sh copy
php bones make:cpt MyCustomPostTypeClass
```

### Third-party Packages

You can install third-party packages by using:

```sh copy
php bones require <PackageName>
```

I recommend using this command instead of `composer require` because by doing so, an automatic renaming will be performed.
