To help you learn more about what's happening within your plugin, you can use the `error_log()` function. As you know, within WordPress you can enable the loggin by adding the following lines in the `wp-config.php` file:

```php
...
/**
 * For developers: WordPress debugging mode.
 *
 * Change this to true to enable the display of notices during development.
 * It is strongly recommended that plugin and theme developers use WP_DEBUG
 * in their development environments.
 */
 define('WP_DEBUG', true);
 define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );
 define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false );
 ini_set('display_errors', 0 );
 ...
```

Anyway, WPBones provides addition configuration that allow you to log messages to files, in a easy a beatiful way.

### Configuration

You can find the configuration for your plugin's logging in the `config/plugin.php`:

```php
...
    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Logging Configuration
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Here you may configure the log settings for your plugin.
    |
    | Available Settings: "single", "daily", "errorlog".
    |
    | Set to false or 'none' to stop logging.
    |
    */

    'log' => 'errorlog',

    'log_level' => 'debug',
```

### Configuring the loggin type

By default, the channel driver is set to `errorlog`. This mean that you'll find the WPBones log in the default WordPress log file, usually `/wp-content/debug.log`. You may use the `single` or `daily` driver as well. In this case, you'll find the log file in `/storage/logs/` folder within your plugin folder.

The `single` channel driver will create a single log file in `/storage/logs/debug.log`.
The `daily` channel driver will create a daily log file in `/storage/logs/20180401.log`.

### Write Log Messages

You may write information to the logs using the `Log` class or the `log()` method from you plugin instance.
The logger provides the eight logging levels defined in the [RFC 5424 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424): emergency, alert, critical, error, warning, notice, info and debug:

```php

use YourNamespace\WPBones\Foundation\Log\Log;

class MyClass {

  public function myMethod()
  {
    Log::debug( 'info', [ 'context' => 'any' ] );
  }

}

```

<p align="center">
  <img src="/wpbones/WPBones/wiki/images/logging.png" alt="Logging" />
</p>

As you can see, the log row will be rendered with color console. In this way, will be easy to find your logs.

As mentioned, you may use the global plugin instance function to access to log provider.

```php
use YourNamespace\WPBones\Foundation\Log\Log;

class MyClass {

  public function myMethod()
  {
    Plugin()->log()->debug( 'info', [ 'context' => 'any' ] );
  }
}

```

Of course, in the Service Provider you may use:

```php
use YourNamespace\WPBones\Foundation\Log\Log;
use YourNamespace\WPBones\Support\ServiceProvider;

class MyServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider {

  public function register()
  {
    $this->plugin->log()->debug( 'info', [ 'context' => 'any' ] );
  }
}

```

## Helper functions

You may use also the `logger()` function

```php
logger()->debug('Hello, World');
logger()->info('Hello, World');
```

As `logger()` is a common function name, if you get any issues, for instance conflict, you can use `wpbones_logger()` instead. In fact, `logger()` is just an alias of `wpbones_logger()`

```php
wpbones_logger()->debug('Hello, World');
wpbones_logger()->info('Hello, World');
```
