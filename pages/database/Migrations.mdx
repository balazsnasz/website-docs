WP Bones provides a simple implementation of the migration. Of course, this implementation is a little bit different than Laravel migration. First of all, you can use `php bones migrate:create` in order to create a migration file:

```shell
php bones migrate:create MyTable
```

You'll see a new file in `/database/migrations/` folder, looking like to `/database/migrations/2016_01_28_131206_create_mytable_table.php`. This file contains your class migration:

```php
use WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Migrations\Migration;

return new class extends Migration
{

  public function up()
  {
    // Create your table
  }

}
```

For example, if you want a _products_ table, please use:

```
php bones migrate:create Products
```

Edit the migration file like this:

```php
use WPKirk\WPBones\Database\Migrations\Migration;

return new class extends Migration {

  public function up()
  {

    $this->create('products', "(
              log_id bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
              user_id bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
              activity varchar(20) NOT NULL default 'updated',
              object_id bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL default '0',
              object_type varchar(20) NOT NULL default 'post',
              activity_date datetime NOT NULL default '0000-00-00 00:00:00',
              PRIMARY KEY  (log_id),
              KEY user_id (user_id)
         ) {$this->charsetCollate};" );

  }
};
```

Remember that the migrations files will be executed when a plugin is activated. You'll see in the database a table named `wp_products`.

## WordPress prefix

As you know, the real name of the table `products` is `{prefix}_products`. Usually, `{prefix}` is `wp_` for default. Anyway, you don't need to use the WordPress prefix, WP Bones will do that for you.
