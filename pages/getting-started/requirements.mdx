# Requirements

WP Bones has a few system requirements. However, if you are a newbie in [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) or [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), please, visit the related website before continuing.

- PHP >= 7.3+
- git
- composer
- npm
- yarn

The `php bones` command, should be run from your WordPress environment (into the [Vagrant](https://github.com/gfazioli/VagrantUbuntu) or [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/valet)) because it will load WordPress. Also, make sure to install `git` and `composer` in your WordPress environment.
Instead, in your host machine (Mac or PC) you can install `npm`. It is used only by `gulp`.
