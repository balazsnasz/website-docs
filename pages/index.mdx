## Overview

WP Bones is a little Framework providing a set of tools and rules to facilitate the WordPress plugin.
The aim of Bones is to be able to write a Plugin such as [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com/) application.
Sadly, WordPress architecture doesn't currently support composer/vendor philosophy yet.
This is why some amazing features of composer/vendor architecture can't apply yet.

Also, see [Before submit to WordPress repository](before-submit-to-wordpress-repository) section for more coding restrictions information.

The aim of this framework is to use both new and standard development tools in a WordPress environment.
If you like [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), here is the framework for you.

## I love Laravel

If you know [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com/), you will love WP Bones Framework too. I inspired to Laravel while developing WP Bones. Even if, as you can image, the WordPress environment doesn't support Composer as we wished. So, you will find a lot of things similar to Laravel and some others very different.
